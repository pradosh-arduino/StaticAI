# StaticAI
A Simple AI Coded with C#

# How it works?
AI has 2 Phases.

It will generate a random score between 0 to 100

In Phase 1 it will check if the score was > 50

In Phase 2 it will check if the score was bigger than the last one if yes add it as it's didWork

At last it will show how many better scores it got and the most best one
